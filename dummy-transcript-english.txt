I just had a call with Mr. Johnson from TechSolutions Inc. This was a phone call this morning at 11:30 AM.

Mr. Johnson is the purchasing manager there and he's looking for connectors for a new project. It's about a larger project where they're setting up a new production line. The project volume is around 75,000 dollars, so a decent size.

The customer needs specifically DIN connectors, and in larger quantities. He said he needs the parts by the end of next month, so relatively urgent. Various types are needed, mainly for industrial applications.

The decision maker is definitely Mr. Johnson himself, he has budget responsibility. But he also mentioned that his technical manager, a Mr. Smith, needs to give technical approval. The order would go through Mr. Johnson.

Currently the customer is still in the quotation phase. He already has quotes from two other suppliers, but he's not satisfied yet. He's looking for a reliable partner who also offers good technical support.

Regarding the market, he told me that many of his colleagues in the industry have problems with delivery times. Most suppliers need 8 to 12 weeks, but he needs the parts faster. That's an important point for us.

Regarding decision criteria, he clearly said: price is important, but not everything. Quality and especially delivery time are just as important to him. He also mentioned that he's looking for a long-term partner, not just a one-time supplier.

Competitors are mainly two large distributors that he's already contacted. But both have given long delivery times.

My commitment was that I would send him a detailed quote with all technical data by the day after tomorrow. I also said that we can be flexible on delivery time if he decides quickly.

The customer committed to discussing the quote with his technical manager and giving me feedback by the end of this week. He would also like to have a sample delivery to check the quality.

My next step is: create the quote, organize samples and send them to him by the day after tomorrow. Then I'll call him on Friday to see if there are any questions and what the status is.

Internal to-dos: I still need to check with our purchasing department whether we can deliver the required quantities in the short time. I should also check the technical specifications again to make sure our products really fit.
